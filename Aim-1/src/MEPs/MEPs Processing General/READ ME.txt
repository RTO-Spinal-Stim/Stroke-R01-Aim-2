This pipeline was developed with the purpose of obtaining results after a single MEPs sessions
Targeted for Tech Emmergent sessions or PEDs, where the participant comes in and 
the interest is to obtain a RMT to have a reference for the stimulation intensity to use or to see if there was a muscle response. 

MAIN CODE:
A_Smers_processing_dataPrep.m

Inputs: 

From the session need to know:
- The number of trials done per intensity (usually 5 but less could be done in the interest of time)
- The indices of the bad pulses


Example input files to run: 
Y:\Tech Immersion\Patients\ti011_TR\LabChart\Raw data (assume no bad trials)

Output:
