These plots are the affected and unaffected sides' data plotted against each other. The downward sloping line is the constant value line (twice the average value). 

The upward sloping dashed line is the perfect symmetry line (x=y).

The folders here delineate how the data is stratified. Within these folders, the "Intervention" and "SessionOrder" folders indicate how the data points are colored.
